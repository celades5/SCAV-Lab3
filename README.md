# SCAV-Lab3
Lab 3 for SCAV subject at UPF

**Teacher:** Javi Fernandez

Tis readme intents to explain the third lab session in the SCAV subject for the video part.

This repository consists in:

**Pdf:** Pdf file containing screenshots of exercises with results. Plus a link in the header to the *git repository*.

**Python exercises:** Containing the code for all the different exercises needed to compute this lab. Run *ex4* containing the menu of all the lab for a full experience. Run each exercise independently if desired.

-   **NOTE:** The subtitles used are for the video *Big Buck Bunny* but I have used a different video as we can see in the lines below, therefore the subtitles do not match with the video, please take that into account.

**ex1:** For the first exercise, we have to cut 1 minute of a video. The video I decided to use is the following: *Real Madrid vs FC Barcelona 2 - 3 All Goals and Full Highlights*. Therefore:

-   **First:** Using basic ffmpeg commands learned through the course we cut 1 minut of the video, precisely, from **16:57** to **17:57**.

-   **Second:** Using basic ffmpeg commands, we extract the audio from the video and store it into an *.mp3* file with a mono track audio. 

-   **Third:** We downsample the video into a lower bitrate, if we listen to it, we will notice the lower quality in comparisson to the first one.

-   **Fourth** We put the subtitles, audio tunes and video altogether into one container.





**ex5:** This exercise it is just a simple menu that allows you to run an exercise desired.
